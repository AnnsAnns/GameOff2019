# [Cancelled] Project Dasher - Game Off 2019

This game (internally called Project Dasher) never managed to go further than the prototype techdemo stage. The idea was that dashing against a wall would put switch your location to another world. (The theme of the jam was "leaps and bounds") and we had a lot of ambitious for the idea.

Sadly the project failed because of multiple reasons (For example the vanishing of our artists but also the fact that most of the team was extremely busy).

Thanks to everyone in the team that helped.

"Temporary" Assets used:
- https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii
  - Note that I edited the characters design to have a dash animation/effect.
